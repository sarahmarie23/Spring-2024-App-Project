## HW0 - Getting Started

### Indented platform

* ðŸ’š **Android** ðŸ’š - I have an Android phone and I only have experience with Android. Please note that when I say "experience" it is very limited, but hopefully by the end of this project I will have a project I can be proud of.

### Indented framework/programming language

* ðŸ’œ **Kotlin** ðŸ’œ - I have dabbled in Kotlin but a while back I took an app class where we followed tutorials in Java. Kotlin is a lot nicer than Java from what I've experienced. Plus, its' Google's preferred language and would be desirable to future employers.
* ðŸš€ **Jetpack Compose toolkit** ðŸš€ - Also dabbled with this as I was following a course from Google. I like it so I want to continue with it and get some practice with this project.
* ðŸ“± **Material 3 for UI** ðŸ“± - I am a big fan of style standards and best practices. I saw a demo of M3 at a conference and I was sold. It would be really helpful to me as I am not a designer and need some assistance with what's the right way to do it.

### Cross-platform exploration

* ðŸš« **Not at this time** ðŸš« - I considered React Native but I have zero experience with it. Perhaps in the future when I am more competent in Android development, I will try it out.
